Data Summary:
- This data set is of 9953 images of 10 species of plants (5
poisonous and 5 nonpoisonous) scraped from the iNaturalist network [1]. There
are approximately 1000 images of each species. While the data is hosted on
Kaggle, it is scraped straight from iNaturalist, cited in other works, and we could
not obtain these images through another reasonable method.
