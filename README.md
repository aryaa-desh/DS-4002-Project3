#### Section 3: Instructions for Reproducing Results
1. Navigate to the DATA folder and download the data in the Google Drive link under the DATA folder
2. Upload data into whatever enviroment you use (e.g. Google Colab or VS Code)
3. After uploading the file, navigate to the SCRIPTS folder and upload the Image_Preprocessing.ipynb script, this will change the formatting of all the images to 244x244
4. With both the script and data uploaded, run the script to do the data pre-processing
5. After running the scripts file, you will then have created a pre-processed file similar to archive_244.zip
6. After this, navigate once again to SCRIPTS folder
7. There you will find the file called Project3_EDA1.ipynb, put this into your enviroment and run it
8. Once again navigate to the SCRIPTS folder and upload the modeltrain-analysis.ipynb, run it as well
